### Simple Linear Regression Project - Salary Prediction Using OLS Estimation
#### Objective:
This project aimed to predict Salary using Simple Linear Regression and OLS Estimation. The analysis involved extracting key metrics like bias, regression coefficients, and evaluating model performance using R-squared and Adjusted R-squared.
#### 1. Data Analysis:
A Simple Linear Regression model was built to predict Salary based on a single predictor variable.
#### 2. OLS Estimation:
Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), the bias (intercept) and partial regression coefficient (slope) were estimated.
#### 3. Model Evaluation:
R-Squared (0.957): The model explains 95.7% of the variance in the Salary, showing a strong fit.

Adjusted R-Squared (0.955): A slight reduction from R-squared, indicating the model is not overfitting despite a high number of observations.

Confidence Intervals: Confidence intervals for both bias and slopes were calculated, giving an indication of the precision of the parameter estimates.
#### 4. Standard Error of Estimates:
The standard error was computed for both bias and slopes, quantifying the accuracy of the estimated coefficients.
#### 5. Best Fitted Line:
The best fitted line was plotted, showing the relationship between the predictor variable and Salary.
#### 6. Result: 
The Simple Linear Regression model provides a strong fit with an R-squared of 0.957, indicating that the predictor variable explains nearly 96% of the variance in Salary. The model is statistically sound with narrow confidence intervals and low standard errors for the estimated parameters. The analysis demonstrates a solid predictive relationship between the predictor and Salary, with no signs of overfitting.
